# System_Automation_using_an_Excel_Macro

This project is to build an excel macro to automate a certain system which I worked on during my volunteering acitivity at UCCD Mansoura Engineering.
My volunteering work is to organize the data ,comes in an excel sheet, of students who enrolled at the UCCD courses.

Previously we has done a laborious work taking the excel sheet of a certain course and:
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) manually entering certain data in a website as a confirmation step. 
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) manually creating two files for each student.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) saving those two files for each studnet into a folder named after this student.

The designed excel Macro do all the previous automatically after you run a code written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) inside the excel sheet.
